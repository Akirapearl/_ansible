# ansible portfolio

This repository contains my current ansible configurations to deploy multiple scenarios each of them with different topology.

**Ordered by creation date:

  1. files_base 
        Scenario with two hosts, first one its an Ubuntu based server which runs Apache and shares the default working directory 
        /var/www/html) with the client (also debian/ubuntu based) via nfs ,that path will be mounted into non-root user's home directory.
