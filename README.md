# Ansible portfolio

This repository contains my current ansible configurations to deploy multiple scenarios each of them with different topology.

**Ordered by creation date:**

  1. January-February 2021 -  files_base 
  
        Scenario with two hosts, first one its an Ubuntu based server which runs Apache and shares the default working directory 
        (/var/www/html) with a host workstation (also running debian/ubuntu based) via nfs ,that path will be mounted into non-root user's home directory.
        
	The client will be provided with an open source ide to work with (Atom).

  2. March - ??? 2021 - files_project01
        
	Taken first scenario as a reference/base point, added an Opensuse machine with the role of DNS, so the topology can keep growing.
	DNS file is provided by Ansible server(pre-configured), service is both installed and fully configured via Ansible too.
